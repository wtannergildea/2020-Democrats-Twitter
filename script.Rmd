# The Data

My plan is to conduct a number of analyses (text sentiment, basic stats, etc) on the Twitter data of current 2020 Democratic primary challengers. To make the project more managable, I will limit my timeline to start at the beginning of 2019.

I created a developer account on Twitter and was able to access its API. Using the twitteR package, I am able to download the text of the tweets from each candidate's personal account, in addition to other data such as their favorite and retweet activity. The data is relatively clean and tidy as is, although I filtered to remove retweets and some other information. In the future, I may include lat/long data to analyze other geographic trends, or see who they interact with the most on Twitter.

Here is the instructive guide I referenced for accessing, downloading, and manipulating the Twitter data using the twitteR package: https://medium.com/the-artificial-impostor/analyzing-tweets-with-r-92ff2ef990c6

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

# Load all necessary packages.

library(twitteR)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggthemes)
library(shiny)
library(shinythemes)
library(tidytext)

# The stop words data is necessary later for sentiment analysis.
data("stop_words")
```

```{r download}

# Access keys from developer app for Twitter's API. I used my own personal account to become a
# developer - nothing much to it.
consumer_key <- "JiBgIY3c2oSYaluzC9901ZpGH"
consumer_secret <- "T0cbKHAWJe6NW3e24F8KvvFeV6lv54aeNmavAGFyL9qHVFm7tL"
access_token <- "1091061777935355905-pd7WDjnoiOSxcEKMgxyucfOLHtOhk4"
access_secret <- "nLgDpWG4FhhbAvTGLeEET1nXkAkbVmMw08uZEmin54sRS"

# This section will actually conduct the download, using the keys above. The maximum number
# of tweets you can pull is limited at 3200. Also, I set the includeRts function to False in order
# to exclude retweets from each candidate.

    consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_secret)

# Sentiment Analysis

# One tab will be dedicated to sentiment analysis. Again, this will be used to differentiate candidates

# Sentiment analysis can be done using many different lexicons. AFINN, Bing, and NRC are three
# standard lexicons included in the tidytext package. A fuller description of these lexicons is included
# in my shiny app.

# To do the analysis, you unest the words like we did before. Then you make sure to exclude filler
# words, known as stop words. This is done using the anti_join function - to remove any matches
# present between the stop words data and the tweets.

# Then, you look for matches between the words and each lexicon. I do this for Bing, NRC, and AFINN # below.

# bing and nrc lexicons are two different baskets of words for positivity/negativity
